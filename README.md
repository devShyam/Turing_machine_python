Visualization of Turing machine's working in python

A simple implementation of Turing machines by where the user can input a custom function 
or use stored models which consists of stored transition functions as a paragraph in a separate file
the turing machine executes by compaing the current state and input alphabet from the tape and searches through the functions dynamically
Simple command line user interface was implemeted for visualization.

more models and documentation will be added when i get back to this project

currently only 1 model has been loaded:
1. number of zeros is equal to number of ones and 0s come before 1s.  <0^n1^n>
